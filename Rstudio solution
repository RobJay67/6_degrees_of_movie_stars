Robert, it seems like the error you're facing is related to SSL certificates or SSH keys. Here are a few potential solutions to address this issue:

1. **Disable SSL Verification (Not Recommended for Production Systems):**
   You can temporarily disable SSL verification within your R session. This is not a secure solution, but it can help you troubleshoot the problem:
   ```R
   httr::set_config(httr::config(ssl_verifypeer = 0L))
   devtools::install_github("bmschmidt/wordVectors")
   ```

2. **Use HTTP Instead of HTTPS (Not Recommended for Production Systems):**
   You might try to install from the HTTP URL directly:
   ```R
   devtools::install_url("http://github.com/bmschmidt/wordVectors/archive/master.zip")
   ```

3. **Update Certificates:**
   It may be that your system's certificates are out of date. You can try updating the CA certificates by updating the 'caTools' package:
   ```R
   install.packages("caTools")
   ```

4. **Check GitHub Repository:**
   Ensure that the repository path is correct, and it's publicly accessible. If the repository has moved or is private, you would encounter this error.

5. **Manually Download and Install:**
   You can manually download the ZIP file from GitHub and then use `devtools::install_local()` to install the package from the downloaded file.

Just a critique of these solutions: Disabling SSL verification or using HTTP instead of HTTPS may expose you to security risks, especially on a production or sensitive system. These options are more for understanding the issue rather than permanent solutions.

If the problem persists, please share any additional details about your R version, system, etc., and I'll do my best to help you out!
